The original repo can't be reproduced directly, keep the changes have done. Forked version has done the changes:

- Add `requirements.txt`
- Change the data loading directory in `_settings.py`
- Load Llama2-7b, nli-roberta-large, bert-base models from huggingface, the original loads from local
- Use llama2-7b as default model, original use llama-7b

**Note: The forked version is for personal use, reproducibility for original paper is not guaranteed.**
